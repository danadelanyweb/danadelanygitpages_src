===

main folder and dist folder have separate gits so I can use webpack w/ an internal folder.

/danagithubpages/ has a .git
this is intended for a code repo
node_modules and dist are ignored

/danagithubpages/dist has a separate .git
/dist is intended for the actual github home page
git clone https://github.com/danadelanyweb/danadelanyweb.github.io.git
